abstract: >-
  Anti-globalization poses the risk of “decoupling” the global manufacturing production system. Improving the status of the Global Value Chain (GVC) within the manufacturing system has become a strategic requirement for many countries.   As a new economic growth point with high potential, the service economy undoubtedly plays an essential role in optimizing and upgrading the GVC.   Therefore, based on the OECD ICIO table, this article empirically investigates the relationship between productive service intermediate inputs and participation in the GVC with its mechanism.    The results show that productive service intermediate inputs can facilitate the upward movement of countries’ GVC participation towards a higher value-added end; such a promotion effect can be achieved through channels of improving servitization of manufacturing, which is related to financial restraints and production and operational efficiency, and, at the same time, manifests less pronounced for the reason of "crowding out" effect of innovation capability.
