  As a crucial driver supporting high-tech start-ups, Government Venture Capital funds are preferred by governments worldwide for their combination of "visible" and "invisible" hand, which raises the question of whether it can incentivize companies to improve their environmental governance and social responsibility performance. This article investigates the impact of GVC funds on the ESG performance of firms based on data from 5,000 listed companies on the Shanghai and Shenzhen A Stock from 2000 to 2022. The results indicate that, GVC funds indeed motivate firms to enhance their ESG performance, as evidenced by endogeneity settlements and robustness tests; mechanism tests reveal that, GVC funds enhance ESG performance by guiding social capital, incentivizing innovation, and fostering political connections; heterogeneity analyses show that the positive impact of GVC funds on ESG performance is more pronounced if the fund scale is larger, or the firms are state-owned and in their mature stages.
