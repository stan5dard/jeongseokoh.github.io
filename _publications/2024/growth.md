abstract: >-
  As economic globalization shifts towards regionalization, complex knowledge becomes more crucial. Recently, a burgeoning literature has explored how complex knowledge facilitates economic growth. Given the representativeness of the ``Belt and Road" Initiative in world economic regionalization, we extend this discussion within the countries involved, and make several distinctions. First, by combining the Fitness and Complexity (FC) Algorithm and the matrix-estimation exercise in the bipartite network, we develop a more comprehensive and effective method to measure knowledge complexity based on the similarity and specialization of patents’ outputting structure. Second, by employing the Instrument Variable Fixed Effect Quantile Regression (IV-FEQR) method, we investigate the economic effects of complex knowledge production while considering heterogeneity and endogeneity issues. Our findings indicate that increasing knowledge complexity significantly promotes a country's economic growth, a result that remains robust across various checks. The benchmark result can be explained theoretically well through the macro-level international competitive advantage and micro-level innovational practice, both enhanced by complex knowledge and the two underlying driving forces that can also be empirically identified. Heterogeneity results further reveal that the promotion effect varies across regions and “expirations”. Our analysis offers practical insights for measuring knowledge complexity and provides important policy implications for boosting economic growth under the current geopolitical tension.
