  The construction of the Global Value Chain has benefited the global economy. However, while geo-political shock has been believed to affect trade and investment volumes, does it truly impact countriesâ€™ integration into the Global Value Chain? In this article, we develop a theoretical framework to explore the impact of geo-political shock on GVC participation and what and how other factors will moderate; then, we conduct empirical studies based on data encompassing 77 countries from 1995 to 2020. The results show that geo-political shock indeed hinders the enhancement of GVC participation, but financing convenience actually alleviates such hindrance; meanwhile, political alignment and media attention, as external forces, indirectly moderate the negative impact of geo-political shock on GVC participation by influencing the alleviating role of financing convenience.
